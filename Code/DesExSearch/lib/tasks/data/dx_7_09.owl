2. Set-up: To set up the game distribute a stack of cards and markers to participants. Everyone should have the same number of cards and distribution should happen after rules are given. 

Play (keep strictly to the time limit):
3. First 3 minutes: Generate a pool of characteristics: think about aspects of the topic and write each down on a separate index card.
4. 12 Minutes: Develop concepts: divide the group into pairs. Each team draws 3 cards randomly from the pool. Teams develop concepts from the chosen cards.
5. 3 minutes: Make presentations: Each team presents the concepts they came up with. When presenting to the larger group, teams may reveal the cards that they drew and how the cards influenced their thinking.</Ontology1398680558:hasProcess>

        <process>1. Purpose: Consider the urgency of the meeting; whats going on and whats on fire? If this is difficult to articulate, ask yourself if a meeting is really necessary
2. Product: What specific artifact will we produce out of the meeting? What will it do and how will it serve the purpose?
3. People: Who needs to be there, and what role will they play? 
4. Process: What agenda will the meeting participants use to create the product? Of all the 7Ps, the agenda is where you have the most opportunity to collaborate in advance.
5. Pitfalls: What are the risks of the meeting, and how will they be addressed? 
6. Prep: What would be useful to do in advance? This could be material to read in advance, research to conduct, or homework to assign to the attendees.
7. Practical concerns: These are the logistics of the meeting--the where and when and importantly, who&apos;s bringing lunch?

Each of the 7Ps can influence or change one of the others, and developing a good plan requires taking this into account.</process>
        <Description>When preparing for a meeting, thinking through the 7Ps (Purpose, product, people, process,pitfalls, prep, practical) can improve focus and results, even if you have only a few moments to reflect on them. Note that a great plan can&apos;t guarantee  a great outcome, but it will help lay down the fundamentals from which you can adapt. 

The 7Ps can give you a framework for designing a meeting, but they can&apos;t run the meeting for you. However, developing plans, for meetings or the project as a whole, helps the team work together more efficiently.</Description>

        <Description>&quot;AEIOU&quot; is mneumonic device, to help reserachers remember to pay attention to and code five types of data during observations. Each one of the letters corresponds to a category: Activities, Environments, Interactions, Objects, Users. It&apos;s important to not only pay attention to the elements of the framework, but also the interactions between them. 

The AEIOU process should be conducted at the very beginning of your design process so that you understand exactly what and where your product relates to.

The AEIOU framework was originated in 1991 at Doblin by Rick Robinson, Ilya Prokopoff, John Cain, and Julie Pokorny. Its aim was to help analyze Ethnomethodology data and Conversation analysis with MECE (Mutually exclusive/collectively exhaustive) categories.</Description>
        <process>To conduct this method, use the AEIOU framework as a lens during observations. You might consider bringing pre-formated sheets to help record the observations under the appropriate headings, writing them as a reminder somewhere accessible, or memorizing them (with practice).

Below is how Christina Wasson defines each element of the framework:
-Activities are goal directed sets of actions- things which people want to accomplish
-Environments include the entire arena where actions take place.
-Interactions are between a person and someone or something else, and are the building blocks of activities.
-Object are building blocks of the environment, key elements sometimes put to complex or unintended users, changing their function, meaning and context.
-Users are the consumers, the people providing the behaviors, preferences and needs.

Supplement this method with photos or video, and follow it with processing the data (e.g., clustering observations into higher level themes).</process>

        <process>An effective action plan should give a definite timetable and set of clearly defined steps to help you to reach your objective. For each objective there should be a separate action plan.

1. Identify your objectives, choosing objectives that are achievable and measurable
2. Prioritize tasks effectively
3. Identify steps needed to achieve your goals, who is required to achieve the action, and what are your deadlines

Once you have produced an action plan, it must be reviewed regularly to ensure the actons are being completed. &quot;</process>

        <Description>The affinity diagram is a creative process used for organizing large amounts of data, ideas and insights by identifying their natural correlations. The purpose of an affinity diagram is to sort large amounts of data into logical groups, but it can be used for problem identification, defining the circumstances, diagnosis and problem-formulation, solutions and working hypotheses, activation of solutions, programmed application of solutions.  In some cases, users or other stakeholders may be involved.

Most often, affinity diagrams are used to analyze findings from field studies, identify and group user functions as part of design, or analyze findings from a usability evaluation.</Description>
        <process>The basic process for creating an affinity diagram is:

1. Put opinions, data, and/or ideas onto cards (or sticky notes), limiting one per card
2. Look for cards that seem to be related
3. Group similar items

Teams may want to name the groups, or sort large clusters into subgroups for easier management and analysis. You may also want to restart a few times to get at different ways of organizing the information and/or perspectives.

Variations include:
 - anonymizing the cards by distributing the cards randomly before sorting (this may be important in some sensitive situations where people may feel judged for the cards they contribute)
 - silent organizing
 - reading each card aloud and asking for similar cards
 - color coding each card/sticky in particular ways to code more information (see Contextual Inquiry)</process>

        <Notes>&quot;Appreciative Inquiry uses &quot;&quot;understanding-through-empathy&quot;&quot; during first-hand interviews with stakeholders of the organization. Its bias is toward the direct interaction with and observation of the people in an organization rather than a detached analysis of facts, figures, charts, benchmark comparisons, and discussions with executives only.

Questions often revolve around what people enjoy about an area, their aspirations for the future, and their feelings about their communities.

1) The constructionist principle proposes that what we believe to be true determines what we do, and thought and action emerge from relationships. Through the language and discourse of day to day interactions, people co-construct the organizations they inhabit. The purpose of inquiry is to stimulate new ideas, stories and images that generate new possibilities for action.

2) The principle of simultaneity proposes that as we inquire into human systems we change them and the seeds of change, the things people think and talk about, what they discover and learn, are implicit in the very first questions asked. Questions are never neutral, they are fateful, and social systems move in the direction of the questions they most persistently and passionately discuss.

3) The poetic principle proposes that organizational life is expressed in the stories people tell each other every day, and the story of the organization is constantly being co-authored. The words and topics chosen for inquiry have an impact far beyond just the words themselves. They invoke sentiments, understandings, and worlds of meaning. In all phases of the inquiry effort is put into using words that point to, enliven and inspire the best in people.

4) The anticipatory principle posits that what we do today is guided by our image of the future. Human systems are forever projecting ahead of themselves a horizon of expectation that brings the future powerfully into the present as a mobilizing agent. Appreciative Inquiry uses artful creation of positive imagery on a collective basis to refashion anticipatory reality.

5) The positive principle proposes that momentum and sustainable change requires positive affect and social bonding. Sentiments like hope, excitement, inspiration, camaraderie and joy increase creativity, openness to new ideas and people, and cognitive flexibility. They also promote the strong connections and relationships between people, particularly between groups in conflict, required for collective inquiry and change.&quot;&quot; (Wikipedia)&quot;</Notes>
        <process>Appreciative Inquiry has two key steps, followed by implementation steps. The key steps are:
1. &quot;Define&quot; the situation, using positive language (e.g., &apos;Ways to accelerate recruitment&apos; rather than &apos;Ways to fix the recruitment problem&apos;)
2. &quot;Discover&quot; what the best past examples are by collecting stories from as many people as you sensibly can. Try to identify &quot;life giving forces&quot;.Questions should be designed to get people to tell sstories about what they find most valuable or what works particularly well.

You may follow this with whatever processing/ideation/building methods you prefer, but the method suggests using the following &quot;implementation steps&quot;, continuing to involve organization/community members in each:
3. &quot;Dream&quot; of what could be, identifying ways to reinforce the positives found in the last stage.
4. &quot;Design&quot; ways to create that future, dealing with practicalities and needed resources. What are the systems, processes, and strategies needed?
5. &quot;Deliver&quot; by starting to implement the design.</process>

        <Description>Appreciative Inquiry sets out to discover elements and factors in an organization that enable it to succeed and then build on those elements to help the organization succeed. 

The questions used in this method are designed to encourage people to tell stories from their own experience of what works. By discussing what has worked in the past and the reasons why, the participants can go on to imagine and create a vision of what would make a successful future that has a firm grounding in the reality of past successes.</Description>

        <Description>This method is a way to break down a system (e.g., service offering, tech platform, supply chain, company initiative, or group culture) into it&apos;s component parts by repeatedly asking the question &quot;how does this component break down further&quot;. It is useful for unpacking large but poorly understood structures. It is similar to Action Planning in process, but different in goal. The outputs of the method document the system parts, but may also be used as inputs to other methods or activities.</Description>
        <process>1. Open the exercise by putting the name of the system on a sticky note at the top of a large whiteboard. Introduce the exercise as a way to understand what the system is made of in tangible terms, by breaking it down into its atoms. 
2. To start the brainstorming, ask the group to &quot;split&quot; the main system into its components. In this step you are generating a list of things to capture on sticky notes directly below the main topic. Generally, a short list of three to five large components is the norm. 
3. For each item, repeat the splitting process by asking &quot;What combines to create this?&quot; In this manner, you will build a pyramid of components all the way down. 

At some point, usually 4 to 5 layers deep, there is a natural turning point. Instead of becoming more diverse, the items start to ebcome more fundamental.</process>

        <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&DesignExchange_Methods;Questionnaires"/>
        <process>The usual method of assessment is to used a standardized opinion questionnaire to avoid criticisms of subjectivity.

1. Identify or develop the questionnaire you will use. You may want to use a mix of closed-ended and open-ended questions.  Often, Likert-Style questions (e.g., Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree) will be used to quantify the qualitative opinions of respondents. However, in these cases it is recommended to include statements that contridict each other to screen for people who simply mark one category without considering the question.

As with other surveys, the quality of the assessment will benefit by doing some preliminary study to inform the question development.

2. Administer the survey to your target population. For more on sampling, see Recruitment Methods. If you are doing a mass mailing, expect an approximate 20% response rate, possibly higher with online communications (e.g., email). You can increase your response rate to nearly 100% by doing reminder personal calls if you have that capability.

If you are using the questionnaire as part of a lab test, ensure that the completed questionnaires can be associated with all the other data (time scores, tapes, sample outputs etc.) from the respondents,  so you don’t have questionnaires which you cannot match up with the rest of the data.

Do not prompt the respondent on how to reply. If a respondent says that a question is inapplicable or wrong, tell them words to the effect that it is up to them to make their own judgement about each question, and that there are no right or wrong answers. Encourage them not to skip questions.

3. Collect questionnaires from respondents for analysis.</process>

        <Description>Attitude Questionnaires are types of surveys (or a portion of a larger survey) designed to gather information about how a user feels about the product/situation being tested.  This is distinct from the efficiency or effectiveness of the product, and may be coupled with questions pertaining to those aspects.

The questionnaire usually produces a list of satisfying and unsatisfying features, which is especially useful if testing is taking place during development.</Description>

2. List its attributes. For a simple physical object like a pen, this might include: Material, Shape, Target market, Colours, Textures, etc.
3. Choose, say, 7-8 of these attributes that seem particularly interesting or important.
4. Identify alternative ways to achieve each attribute (e.g. different shapes: cylindrical cubic, multi-faceted….), either by conventional enquiry, or via any idea-generating technique.
5. Combine one or more of these alternative ways of achieving the required attributes, and see if you can come up with a new approach to the product or process you were working on.</process>

        <Description>This technique breaks an existing product or system down into its component parts, and then explores different ways of modifying or replacing each part for the same or better effect, with the goal of recombining the parts into a new forms of the system. Attributes are those different categories into which the physical, psychological and social characteristics of things can be placed. By listing attributes, you gain both general and specific views of the &quot;&quot;world&quot;&quot; of that subject. Unfortunately,  it&apos;s not clear how to deal with all the permutations this method would create. However, it&apos;s similar to later techniques such as Morphological Analysis.</Description>

It is a process in which the author is both the informant and the investigator.It is useful for uncovering personal biases and preconceptions that could interfere with the design system. The designer also gains experience in thinking of the self as a member of and outsider to a group, placing his or her activities within an analytic context.

Autoethnography is used at the beginning of the design stage when designers want to better understand how a consumer views and interacts with the product in question. This method can also be an inexpensive means to test out ethnographic procedures prior to initiating a larger-scale study.</Description>
        <process>The author must:
1. Adopt as objective a stance as possible
2. Usually in first person point of view, record personal activities as soon as possible after the observed/experienced behavior
3. Review and summarize notes (most often compiled as &quot;reflexive journal summaries&quot;)</process>

        <process>Collect and/or examine artifacts or evidence of artifacts (i.e., observe the material surroundings and behaviors that produce them). 

Examine and/or document behavior or sequences of behavior without considering the actor&apos;s thoughts or intentions. There are three scales to consider:
a. Interaction scale: focus on regularity and variation in single person-object interactions. Universal principles of behavior might be discovered.
b. Activity Scale: variation in activities performed by individuals, or groups is examined. An activity may be defined as a set of sequentially related interactions that takes place in a location, among interactors that at least need one person or an artefact.
c. Systemic scale: in an organization of one or more behavioral systems (a set of patterned activities that make up a human group such as household, community, etc.)</process>
        <Description>Behavioral archaeology is the study of material objects, regardless of time or space, in order to describe human behavior, building on the theory that artifacts, architecture and other items in a work or living space are the product of human actions. Behavioral archeology focuses on observing and understanding what people actually did or do, while refraining from considering people’s thoughts and intentions in explaining that behaviour. This method reveals how artifacts and environments figure in people&apos;s lives, highlighting aspects of their lifestyle, habits, priorities, and values.

Behavioral Archaeology can be used to investigate both past and present human behaviors (and is used as an approach to archaeological research). However,  for design, it is most useful for 
1. Designing Long-term behavioral change by developing laws that represent both past and present human behavior and uses.
2. Answering questions about ongoing societies/Uses by studying present material objects in current cultural systems to describe and explain present human behavior.</Description>

For example, Visual Basic may be used as the prototyping language, while C++ is intended for the development project.

The detail is seen in the context of the overview, with continuity across the boundaries, rather than existing in a disjoint window.</Description>
        <process>To achieve this goal, the display should achieve the following:
1. Clearly indicates how the values relate to one another, which in this case is a part-to-whole relationship - the number of deaths per cause, when summed, equal all deaths during the year.
2. Represents the quantities accurately.
3. Makes it easy to compare the quantities.
4. Makes it easy to see the ranked order of values, such as from the leading cause of death to the least.
5. Makes obvious how people should use the information - what they should use it to accomplish - and encourages them to do this.

2. Withhold criticism: In brainstorming, criticism of ideas generated should be put &apos;on hold&apos;. Instead, participants should focus on extending or adding to ideas, reserving criticism for a later &apos;critical stage&apos; of the process. By suspending judgment, participants will feel free to generate unusual ideas.
3. Welcome unusual ideas: To get a good and long list of ideas, unusual ideas are welcomed. They can be generated by looking from new perspectives and suspending assumptions. These new ways of thinking may provide better solutions.
4. Combine and improve ideas: Good ideas may be combined to form a single better good idea, as suggested by the slogan \&quot;1+1=3\&quot;. It is believed to stimulate the building of ideas by a process of association.</Ontology1398680558:hasProcess>

        <Description>The CARD (Collaborative Analysis of Requirement and Design) technique is a meeting documentation method. It essentially creates cards that explain the results of a discussion or series of discussions, all of which can be used for more formal analytical techniques. This method is used to help the Design Team&apos;s members better understand each other&apos;s backgrounds and work history, as well as brainstorm innovations to improve the current design process. It could also be used as a workshop-technique, where participants are members of an organization under study, rather than members of the design team. In this case, design team members may act as facilitators and/or observers.</Description>
        <process>A typical CARD session progresses as follows:
1. Introducing People - Team members introduce their names, workplace group interests, etc.
2. Introducing Materials - Each person fills out his/her card with an activity or component of an activity that could occur in the workplace.
3. Work of the Session - The team engages in three sessions of deep involvement:
- Participatory Analysis - Each user describes his or her work and the other members ask questions
- Participatory Design - The entire team discusses a user&apos;s work and/or possible innovations in work practice and technologies.
- Participatory Assessment - The entire team collectively critiques a specific work practice.</process>

        <Notes>The first documented usage of CARD Technique was that of the studies in the work of U S West telephone companies during 1993-1996 Cards for the CARD sessions were based off of the training materials required of the components of the work, and included activities such as &quot;&quot;customers&apos; requests and clarifications, operators&apos; work with keyboard and screen,&quot;&quot; etc.

        <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&DesignExchange_Methods;User_Interface_Prototypes"/>
        <Notes>Constantine, et al., claim that using a common abstract design vocabulary facilitates comparison between designs, as well as recognition and description of common design patterns. 

Benefits of this Method:
Design process is more manageable while allowing human creativity and thought to be more targeted toward the important aspects of the design

Deficits of this Method:
Significant details for implementation and realization are not recognized at this stage, leaving it up to resolution by a designer.

In many ways, this method is represented by tools such as Balsamiq that provide a standard set of interface widgets to build an interactive wireframe mockup, though system behavior can also be modeled in Balsamiq.</Notes>
        <aka>Balsamiq wireframes, standardized wireframes</aka>
        <process>The set consists of three generic or all-purpose abstract components (the container, the action/operation, and the active material) plus an assortment of auxiliary, special-purpose components that have proved useful in practice (e.g., elements, collections, select, delete, editable elements, etc.). Since all the materials are effectively specializations of the generic container and all the tools are specializations of the generic operation/action, generic components can always be used for any purpose. For conventional designs, each canonical component is simply realized by one or more standard user interface widgets.

To generate the canonical abstract model from a task model:
1. For each cluster of closely related task cases, an interaction context is provisionally defined. For each task case in a cluster, the defining dialog or narrative is examined.
2. For each step in the narrative, the interface contents necessary for performance of the step are identified and appropriate abstract tools and materials are added to the contents of the interaction context. In practice, this is often accomplished using sticky notes to represent abstract components
3. Where specialized Canonical Abstract Components are clearly needed or preferred, these are used; otherwise, generic tools, materials, or combinations are used. Canonical Abstract Components model the various interactive functions–such as interrupting an action or displaying a collection of information–needed within the realized user interface.
4. Once all the necessary tools and materials have been incorporated into the interaction context, the layout and organization of the interaction context are explored. Area is allocated based on such things as importance, complexity, and user focus.
5. Abstract Components are positioned according to such issues as workflow and conceptual or semantic interrelationships and may be by combined into composite components when meaningful and potentially useful.</process>
        <Description>Canonical abstract prototypes use a toolkit of standardized abstract interface components (refraining from specifying details of appearance or behavior) to help specify and explore visual and interaction design ideas. The standardized components are meant to help bridge between abstract models (e.g., task flows and wireframes) and realistic or representational prototypes (e.g., photoshop mockups). 

As described by Constatine et al., these prototypes:
· are constructed from specific abstract components selected from a toolkit of standard components described in a uniform notation 
· show layout, including relatives size, position, and nesting or overlay of components 
· use the same standard vocabulary of the users and application domain as employed in other models throughout a project

Canonical Abstract Prototyping is appropriate when attempting to take a task model and create a complete yet abstract conceptual design for the entire user interface. This makes generating a realistic model more straightforward.</Description>

        <Notes>Sessions can be run in four contexts:

1. 1:1 - in this setting, the facilitator and respondent are in the same space. Respondents are asked to think aloud while sorting, and facilitators may look on and ask questions as needed.
2. Group/Independent - multiple in-person sessions happen at the same time, but respondents each sort their own set of cards independently with little interaction with the facilitator or other respondents.
3. Group - In this setting, a group of respondents works together to sort the cards. This may bring about groupings and labels more quickly, but may lose the variation in how different respondents think about the information being sorted.
4. Remote - in this setting, the respondent works on their own computer away from the facilitator. In general, the respondent will work completely independently, though an audio or video call may be set up to allow the facilitator to observe or listen to the respondent working. Several software programs that support this activity will analyze the collected data for you.

Benefits of the method: The users can utilize all their senses when investigating the cards allowing them to possibly create new categories of sorting that may not have appeared before.

Deficits of the method: 
Often times, the objects can have strange and/or unwanted relationships that skew the sorting away from the intended categories and perspectives. Furthermore, the sorting can only address &quot;static, flat, [and] explicit knowledge,&quot; rather than providing more tacit knowledge about structured relationships.</Notes>
        <process>Who: 
1. Recruit members of your target audience (usually 4-10)
2. Schedule the participants so that there can be someone nearby to answer questions

What: 
3. On a deck of sturdy identical  (to minimize distractions) cards, write succinct descriptions of the things you want organized (e.g., sections of a website, terms you might use, areas of interest, etc.) - putting too much information on the cards can slow down the process. What you write on the cards should reflect what you&apos;re trying to learn about or test. It&apos;s recommended to shoot for 30-100 cards to provide enough items to sort, while not overwhelming the respondent. For an open sort, you may want to err on the smaller end of this range.

How:
4. Bring the participant in and get them settled.
5. Introduce the card sort concept (e.g, &quot;this is a stack of cards, please sort them into groups that make sense to you&quot;). If possible, randomize the order of presentation so that each piece of content has a chance to be sorted earlier in the session.
6. After the respondant is done grouping, you might have them help you label the groups.
7. Depending on how many cards you have, you might have the respondent do a second round by grouping the groups together into larger groups and then also labeling those (also see: Hierarchical Sort).

After:
For a more formal analysis, consider Cluster Analysis (a numeric technique)
For a less formal analysis, you can eyeball how people group things, paying attention to what they don&apos;t group as well.</process>

        <rdfs:comment>should we list out the setting possibilities as individual submethods?</rdfs:comment>
        <Description>Card Sorting essentially involves the design team selecting a group of people to organize cards spatially, in ways that make sense to them. The respondents could be potential users or other stakeholders. When cards are sorted by members of the design team, it would generally be considered a form of affinity diagramming, a similar method in terms of process (though different in purpose). 

Given a large group of independent respondents, numerical analysis of the resulting sorting can reveal important trends and patterns of the general consumer market. Alternatively, a respondent&apos;s card sort can be used to spur discussion in an interview setting.

Card Sorting is usually used to gather information from users, either to understand which perspectives the users will value most about the product in question, help structure information in an intuitive way, or towards the end of the design process to check and perhaps correct and/or enhance the product to meet the users&apos; preferences, values, and innate understanding.</Description>

2.  Get the group organized: Develop a clear goal, keep members focused on choices, and highlight underlying values of the issues.

4. Make everyone’s role clear: Maintain the focus and let the citizens make the choices.</process>

Depending on the purpose, the group may take different forms (representative sample, group representatives, or particular individuals). The group needs to have access to relevant information and may meet either over a couple of days as a one-off event, or regularly over a longer period. Most costs come from recruitment and retention of members, rather than in the running of the meetings themselves.</Description>

        <Description>Citizens&apos; juries consist of a small panel of non-specialists, modelled on the structure of a criminal jury. The group set out to examine an issue of public significance in detail and deliver a &quot;verdict&quot;. 

Citizens Juries are often used around current, often controversial, public policy issues where opinion is sharply divided and policy makers cannot decide what to do.</Description>
        <process>1. The &quot;jury&quot; is made up of people who are usually selected &quot;at random&quot; from a local or national population, with the selection process open to outside scrutiny.
2. The jurors cross-question expert &quot;witnesses&quot; — specialists they have called to provide different perspectives on the topic — and collectively produce a summary of their conclusions, typically in a short report.
3. The whole process is supervised by an oversight or advisory panel composed of a range of people with relevant knowledge and a possible interest in the outcome. They take no direct part in facilitating the citizens&apos; jury. Members of this group subsequently decide whether to respond to, or act on, elements of this report.</process>

        <Description>A citizens&apos; panel aims to be a representative consultative body of local residents and is typically used by statutory agencies, particularly local authorities and their partners, to identify local priorities and to consult service users and non-users on specific issues. In reality, panels are rarely demographically representative of the public and very few ensure that members represent a cross-section of political or social attitudes.</Description>
        <process>1. Recruit members of community or target population to be members
2. Administer surveys periodically, and possibly conduct more indepth research (such as Focus Groups or Interviews) to monitor public opinion.</process>
        <Notes>This evolved from Opinion Polls and Market Research techniques. Some tips include:
 - Let panel members know what is expected of them during recruitment (e.g., surveys 4-6 times/year, little face-to-face engagement if any, how long they&apos;ll be on the panel, etc.)
 - Engage the panel to 4-6 times per year (some will do once per month, but that may lead to participants dropping out), spaced throughout the year.
 - Vary the form of engagement so participants have a choice in how to be involved (i.e., provide more than just a regular survey).
 - Distribute outcomes of the feedback to participants (consider a newsletter) and the public.
 - Use this method in conjunction with others.</Notes>

        <Description>Citizens&apos; Summits are deliberative meetings involving large numbers of people (typically between 500-5000) and using communication technology to facilitate discussions.

The technology, which includes electronic voting, text messages, and online surveys, makes it possible to engage large numbers of people in the same place, at the same time. Citizens&apos; summits trace their background to 21st Century Town Meetings and the work of AmericaSpeaks in the USA.

The advantage of a public debate is that it brings the local authorities closer to the citizens and the latter closer to the decision making process, increasing thus their involvement in the community. It is an event that catches the mass media&apos;s eye, that is easily disseminated and benefits from a modern methodology which offers the best ratio in terms of information, time and costs. (description from ParticipationCompass)</Description>
        <process>1. The event is structured on work sessions which correspond to the main themes on the public agenda: finding solutions, prioritizing the solution on the main target groups and the selection of the best solutions. 
2. The participants are organized in groups which are moderated by sociologist. 
3. The debates are conceived in sequences, using the focus group methodology and are integrated by the simultaneous votes they receive at the end of each session.</process>

2. Go through your data and mark sections with appropriate codes.
3. Use a recursive, iterative process to develop the codes. Capture developed codes in a codebook
4. Gather all segments with the same code into one place for further analysis.

Variations include open and closed coding. A combination of the two approaches may be used (e.g., starting with a closed system, but revising it as new themes or concepts emerge from the data)</process>

        <rdfs:label>Cognitive Map</rdfs:label>
        <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&DesignExchange_Methods;Data_Processing"/>
        <process>Basic Process:
1. Break a problem into its constituent elements (usually distinct phrases of 10-12 words), retaining the language of the person giving the account of the problem.
2. Treat each phrase as a single concept, and lay them out in a graphical format (with stickies on a whiteboard, on a computer program, etc.). A pair of phrases may be combined into a single phrase/concept if one provides a meaningful contrast to the other (i.e., makes a bi-polar concept)
3. Link phrases based on their cause/effect relationships, to form a hierarchy of means and ends.

Guidelines (some of which apply specifically if you are using this as a note-taking technique during an interview):
 - Separate sentences into distinct phrases.
 - Choose a way to distinguish between types of concepts (e.g., Goals, Strategic Directions, Potential Options) - consider hierachical layout or color coding.
 - Watch out for goals, since they usually don&apos;t come out in the beginning of the explanation of the problem, but are often indicated by body language or intonation, or emphatic expressions of their &quot;goodness.&quot; Goals are considered &quot;good things per se&quot; by the problem owner.
 - Watch out for Strategic Directions - these are higher level concepts that may have a longer term implication, high cost, or need a number of actions to make them happen.
 - Look for opposite poles - you may add them later in the interview/meeting as they are mentioned
 - Identify the option and outcome within each pair of concepts by linking them with an arrow.</process>
        <Description>Cognitive Mapping is a diagram that represents relationships between concepts, where the concepts are linked by cause/effect, means/ends, or how/why relationships. Cognitive Maps were designed to support decision making, so the cause and effect link is essentially to help trace the possible desirable and undesirable outcomes of a decision. Unlike mind maps or concept maps, cognitive maps rarely use words or images as nodes - rather, each node is a phrase expressing an idea, ideally with a verb incorporated (e.g., &quot;increase morale&quot;). In addition, the idea may be &quot;bi-polar&quot; meaning it has contrasting options (e.g., &quot;increase morale rather than decrease morale&quot;; &quot;long wait rather than less than 3 minute wait&quot;). The portion before the &quot;rather than&quot; is the actual outcome, and the portion after is the avoided outcome. 

&quot;Cognitive Map&quot; can also refer to the map someone has in their head of how the world works, which becomes a mental model or mental map once written or drawn.</Description>

        <Notes>Tips:
 - Add meaning to concepts by phrasing concepts in the imperative form and including actors and actions if possible.
 - Retain the words and phrases used by the problem owner to let them retain ownership, but avoid beginning phrases with &quot;need..&quot;, &quot;must..&quot; or &quot;want..&quot; since they may confuse the causal relationship later.
 - Start mapping about 2/3rds of the way up the paper in the middle.
 - Try to keep concepts in small rectangles of text (rather than continuous lines).
 - If possible, keep all concepts on one sheet of paper for easier linking later (30-40 is usually possible)
 - Use soft pencils so you can easily rewrite (or stickies).</Notes>

The user interface is often presented in the form of a paper mock-up or a working prototype, but it can also be a fully developed interface. The input to the walkthrough also include the user profile, especially the users&apos; knowledge of the task domain and of the interface, and the task cases. The evaluators may include human factors engineers, software developers, or people from marketing, documentation, etc. This technique is best used in the design stage of development.

        <Description>&quot;Wiki is a tool used by many to author a document together. This method includes working together to achieve collective results that the participants would be incapable of accomplishing working online. Because of the nature of a wiki to combine all knowledge into one space, users can expect to be more informed after visiting a wiki.

In addition, summarizing a topic and addressing important information is a learning experience of its own. The ability to explain a topic in written form requires a sufficient understanding of the topic alone. 

Dandelion is an extension from Wiki. It is built to support coordinated, collaborative authoring in wikis with a tag-based function that allows specification of co-authoring tasks.  

Dandelion is better at supporting more structured collaborative document authoring, where the role of a coordinator is clear and the document outline is known&quot;

        <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&DesignExchange_Methods;Data_Processing"/>
        <Description>Componential analyis is the systematic search for the attributes (components of meaning) associated with cultural categories. Whenever an ethnographer discovers contrasts among the members of a domain, these contrasts are best thought of as attributes or components of meaning. It has been most frequently used to breakdown the meanings of somewhat related words with particular emphasis placed on kinship analysis words (eg: brother, mother, aunt) and their translation between languages. For example, one could compare the terms sister and brother and find that these terms are parallel in the sense that both are children of the same parent but will find that the words differ in gender identified.

The purpose of Componential Analysis is to organize and represent contrasts discovered through ethnographic or other qualitative research. In design, it may be useful for identifying cultural meanings which may help analyze and understand other information.</Description>
        <process>1. Select a domain for analysis
2. Inventory all contrasts previously discovered - Possibly start  with notes complied from asking contrast questions and/or making selective observations. (e.g. Aremnian Catholics speak Armenian as a first language; Shunni speak Arabic as a first language.)
3. Prepare a paradigm worksheet - consists of an empty paradigm in which you enter the cultural categories of the domain down the lefthand column, while making notes about the relationships between the paradigm and the other domains.
4. Identify dimensions of contrast that have binary values - A dimension of contrast is an idea or concept that has at least two parts, although in this case it specifically has two parts since the values must be binary. (e.g. If you were analyzing the domain &quot;kinds of trees,&quot; you would come up with one dimension of contrast that might be stated &quot;characterized by the presence of leaves.&quot; This is a dimension of contrast related to trees and has two values or parts: &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot;)
5. Combine closely related dimensions of contrast into ones that have multipe values - Instead of &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; dimensions of contrast, add more complex ones such as &quot;First language,&quot; providing more qualitative information.
6. Prepare contrast questions for missing attributes
7. Conduct selective observations to discover missing information
8. Prepare a completed paradigm - This final paradigm can be used as a chart in ethnographic research.</process>

        <process>1. Identify a particular activity or topic you would like to understand more completely. It is most effective to clearly define the range of the topic so as keep the map contained and focused. Writing a Focus Question is a good way to define the domain of the map.
2. Generate a list of 15-20 concepts and rank them from general to specific as they relate to the focus question. 
3. Construct a preliminary map (using paper or computer based tools), organizing the concepts hierarchically based on the ranking in Step 2.
4. Move the concepts around until (by trial and error) the best hierarchy is reached.
5. Add cross-links between subdomains in the map.
6. Add linking words to define relationships between concepts.
7. Revise and rewrite until a final map emerges that answers the focus question.

Ultimately, concept mapping will result in a chart of ideas and their relationships to one another. This form of structuring topics enables the creator to visually understand and review how an overall Focus Question can be broken down into relevant sub-domains of important related concepts.</process>

        <Description>A concept map is a diagram that connects concepts (generally nouns) with arrows labeled with linking words (generally verbs such as causes, requires, etc.) in a downward branching hierarchy.  A key difference between concept mapping and mindmapping is that mindmaps generally have a central concept with a radial or tree structure, whereas concept maps may have multiple root concepts.

In education, Concept Mapping is used as a tool for designing and structuring curricula; also for helping students better retain information. Concept mapping can be utilized in multiple ways including: lesson planning, study guides, and tutorial outlines.</Description>

        <Description>Conjoint analysis allows researchers to establish how much consumers value individual features of products or services. It requires participants to make a series of tradeoffs - essentially choosing between each pair of features or ideas - and then uses quantitative analysis techniques to determine the relative importance of each feature or idea.

Conjoint analysis can be used after there is a final product and a marketing strategy wants to be developed; which features to emphasize and what price to sell it at. It can also be used to determine what specific features and combination of features consumers find to be most important before designing a product.</Description>

        <Notes>Benefits of this method: Simulates the trade-off decisions that consumers make in real life

Conjoint analysis was popularised as a tool for the practical analysis of rank order consumer judgment data by Green and Rao (1971) and Green and Wind (1973).

The theory that underlies the design and analysis of rank-order judgment experiments was developed by several writers (for example, Luce and Tukey, 1964; Kruskal, 1965; Tversky, 1967), and is summarised in Krantz et al, (1971).</Notes>
        <process>1. Decide on the set of features or ideas you want to test.
2. Simple conjoint analysis can be carried out by telephone or face-to-face interview. More complex problems may call for a computer-driven interview.
3.Have participants rate or rank combinations of features, or to choose between two or more combinations. This forces them to make trade-off decisions which is closer to how they make choices in real life.
4. Analysis of the ratings allocates a value to each feature and to each of the options from which it is possible to estimate the value of any combination of these elements.</process>

        <process>1. Invite a group of citizens (members of the lay public who have no specific knowledge of the issue at hand) to apply, and choose participants to be as demographically representative of the public as possible.
2. Participants attend two preparatory weekends, and given material prepared to gain a basic understanding of the issue.
3. The panel participates in a 4-day conference where they attend Q&amp;A sessions with experts, including opposing views.
4. The citizen participants prepare a final report with their views, opinions, and recommendations for the issue.
5. On the last day of the conference, the citizens discuss their views with policy- and decision-makers.</process>
        <Description>A consensus conference is made up of a panel of citizens who question expert witnesses on a particular topic at a public conference. Their recommendations are then circulated widely. 

A feature of this method is that the initiative lies with the citizens- they who define what the key points of the debate will be, including the choice of questions and selection of the witnesses -they create their own final conclusions. 

In common with Citizens&apos; Juries, Consensus Conferences aim to both inform and consult, but Consensus Conferences take place in the public gaze.</Description>

Content models can be used in a variety of ways depending on the level of abstraction and simplicity. Content inventories, the most simple and abstract form, consist of simple lists inventorying the information and controls to be collected within a given project or interaction.

Content models are appropriate during the prototype generation phase of the design process, when the design is still in more abstract forms.

        <process>There are three things to consider in creating a content model:

1. The assembly model: The way content creators will put individual content items together to make webpages, campaigns, documents, or other content products.
2. The content types: The various configurations of content that are distinct enough to be unique types in the system.
3. The content attributes: The content and metadata elements that make up each type, including how they relate to each other.

        <process>The following process is for a team-based discussion.

Before the meeting: 
1. Hang six sheets of flip chart paper on  a wall in a 2-row x 3-column format. 
2. On the top-middle sheet, in the bottom center, draw a visual representation of the organization or project under discussion. Label the picture or scene. 
3. On the top left of the same sheet, write &quot;Political Factors&quot;. On the top right of the same sheet, write &quot;Economic Climate.&quot; 
4. On top-left sheet of paper, draw several arrows pointing to the right. Label the sheet &quot;Trends.&quot;
5. On the top-right sheet of paper, write &quot;Trends&quot; again pointing to the left.
6. On the bottom-left sheet, draw large arrows pointing up and to the right. Label this &quot;Technology Factors&quot; 
7. On the bottom-middle sheet, draw a person or two, and write &quot;Customer Needs&quot;
8. On the bottom-right sheet, draw a thundercloud or a person with a question mark overhead and label this sheet &quot;Uncertainties&quot;

At the meeting:
9. Introduce the context map to the group. Explain that the goal is to get a picture of the context within which the organization operates.
10. Discuss all categories and as a group think of what to put in each category, but holding off on &quot;Trends&quot; until the end.
11. Allow the group to qualify what types of trends to look at for each Trend category (online, demographic, growth, etc.).
12. Summarize the overall findings with the group and ask for observations, insights, and concerns about the context map.</process>
        <Description>Context maps are designed to show the external factors, trends, and forces at work surrounding an organization. These include: politcal factors, economic climate, technology factors, customer needs, uncertainties, and trends. They are best constructed with input from the entire team, but can also be created solo.

This method is grounded on the idea that once we have a systemic view of the external environment we&apos;re in, we are better equipped to respond proactively to that landscape.</Description>

        <process>Thomas and Bevan provide a detailed checklist of items to collect information on in their Guide to Usability Context Analysis, including things like types of users, their skills and attributes, etc.

One way to collect the information about context of use is to arrange a half-day meeting. Invite stakeholders who have knowledge about the intended users and usage. Suggested people to involve include:
- design researcher(s)
- project manager
- user representative(s)
- developer(s)
- training
- support

A the meeting, discuss and fill in each item on the context checklist. Try to obtain consensus where there is uncertainty or disagreement. If information is missing, agree how this can be obtained. Avoid prolonged discussion of minor issues.

After the meeting obtain any missing information. If the information is not easily available, arrange a field study to observe users in their work environment.</process>
        <Description>Context of Use (CoU) analysis is a specific technique designed to assist developing services or products (primarily software) by posing certain probe questions about the project, based off of a detailed checklist. This is best used when most of the information is already known by the stakeholders (ideally based on previous user studies). The probe questions elicit from the design/development team and other stakeholders information that may be held &apos;below the surface&apos; by one or more of the constituent groups.

Questions asked deal with the following three issues:
1. Who will use the product/service?
2. What will they do with the product/service?
3. Where will they use the product/service?</Description>

Sidebars: reveal interesting facets on the cover story. 
Quotes: can be from anyone as long as they&apos;re related to the story
Brainstorm: is for documenting initial ideas for the cover story
Images are for supporting the content with illustrations. 
3. break the players into groups of 4-6 people and make sure there are markers and one template for each group. Tell the players to populate the template they can either select a scibe or write and draw on it together. 
4. Ask the players to imagine best case scenario ofr their company to take that  scenario one step further. write down the story of the year on the template. 
5. Tell groups to stop and ome together to present their visions first. Give each group 5-10 minutes to share what they imagined was written in the story and supporting elements.

        <Description>Customer Journey Mapping is a tool for visualising how customers interact with people and organisations in order to make a purchase or experience a service. 

Customer Journey Mapping comes from the corporate sector and market research. It can be used as a form of consultation to improve a service through finding out how people use the service and how they interact with the service provider. It provides a map of the interactions and emotions that take place, and can help an organisation provide its customers with the experience it wants them to have. </Description>

Firstly, evidencing has to look finished and convincing, whereas often a paper prototype is designed to look like a rough first draft. This is because the aim is to provide a convincing example of something ‘in the future’. Secondly, evidencing aims to give the experience of how the service will be experienced when completed. It is therefore strong on contextual information regarding its use. Thirdly, evidencing aims to lead by example, or pull a project, by making tangible the end point of the process. Finally, evidencing presents a solution in a holistic way, including branding elements, design elements, interaction elements and behavioural elements. </Description>

The focus or object of analysis is the interaction inside the group.

The questions asked in a focus group are similar to those asked in an one-on-one interview.

        <Description>Heuristic evaluation is a form of usability inspection where usability specialists judge whether each element of a user interface follows a list of established usability heuristics.     

  
A heuristic or expert evaluation can be conducted at various stages of the development lifecycle, although it is preferable to have already performed some form of context analysis to help the experts focus on the circumstances of actual or intended product usage.

It is beneficial to carry out a heuristic evaluation on early prototypes before actual users are brought in to help with further testing.</Description>

Construction is best used in the phase of the design process in which UCD (User-centered Design) is more relevant. This is generally used before a product is released into the market, but may also be used before product development and/or prototyping begins</Description>

 The result is the identification of new criticalities and opportunities in the context of reference.

        <Description>The mind map is a spider diagram used to visualize and elicit the ideas associated with a central concept, topic, or question. It is meant to reflect the non-linearity of human thought and problem solving.

It&apos;s useful for taking notes in meetings or interviews (though that takes practice), or for organizing information in a free association mind dump.</Description>
        <Notes>A similar concept called &quot;Idea Sun Bursting&quot; was developed in the 1970s.</Notes>
        <process>1. Find a large blank space to work on (wall, whiteboard, paper, mindmapping software).
2. Place a problem, idea or central thought in the center of the space, ideally as an image, but a word or short phrase will also work.
3. From the central concept, draw &quot;branches&quot; for related concepts or ideas. These should be your primary categories, as their central location in the map tends to indicate increased importance. These can be words, ideas, tasks, or other items. 
4. For each branch, add additional related (or secondary) concepts or ideas (generally more granular as you move out). Connect the primary and secondary categories with lines.
5. Repeat the process with each smaller branch until you feel all relevant information has been included.

Tips from Buzan:
- Start in the center with an image of the topic, using at least 3 colors.
- Use images, symbols, codes, and dimensions throughout your mind map.
- Select key words and print using upper or lower case letters.
- Each word/image is best alone and sitting on its own line.
- The lines should be connected, starting from the central image. The central lines are thicker, organic and thinner as they radiate out from the center.
- Make the lines the same length as the word/image they support.
- Use multiple colors throughout the mind map, for visual stimulation and also to encode or group.
- Develop your own personal style of mind mapping.
- Use emphasis and show associations in your mind map.
- Keep the mind map clear by using radial hierarchy, numerical order or outlines to embrace your branches.</process>

        <Description>* Naturalistic group interview is an interview technique that allows the researcher to collect information from naturally occurring conversations stemming from the fact that the people chosen for the group interviews all have a previous social relationship with each other.  Group influence tends to be ubiquitous in Asian countries, and it is therefore important to take this group dynamic into account in order to fully understand consumer behavior in this context


Purpose:  Goal of naturalistic group interviewing is to collect empirical data in the natural setting in which a consumption activity normally takes place.


Context: It is appropriate to use this quantitative analytic method at the beginning of the research process, when one is trying to find out consumer beliefs about something.
This method is appropriate for cultures that consider it taboo for people to disclose their thoughts and opinions, or where attitudes and beliefs tend to be formed at the group rather than the individual level.

Online consultations utilise the internet to ask a group of people their opinion on an issue (typically a policy in the development stages). An unlimited number of participants can be sent information about the subject or download it online and respond via email or comment on the website.

Online consultation enables participants to comment in detail and those commissioning the process to collate responses and present the results back to participants quickly, comprehensively and transparently. The fact that the participant comments do not need to be transcribed adds real benefit and speeds up analysis.

Context: You should use an online consultation when:
• There is a clear and achievable aim
• Dealing with a large and/or widely dispersed group of participants
• Participants are more comfortable participating online than in other ways

        <Description>Open coding is a coding system where there is no predefined set of codes before you begin tagging your data. The theory is that the themes and concepts should emerge from the data.</Description>
        <process>To make use of this, realistically, it&apos;s useful to do several iterations. Using the terms from Grounded Theory, this means:

1. Mark key points of data with codes. Expect a cycle of discussion, immersion of new coding themes, and revision of codes.
2. Group codes into concepts.
3. Group concepts into categories.
4. Use categroies to create a &quot;theory&quot; (i.e., a collection of explanations that explain the subject of the research)

Guidelines:
 - Used a recursive, iterative process to develop the codes, discussing among the research team to support and understand the codes. 
 - Use a codebook to document decisions, definitions, and rules of coding. Revise after discussion and as themes emerge.</process>
        <Notes>Benefits of Method:
-Increase understanding of the phenomenon being studied
-A good way to analyze data from interview transcripts

Deficits of Method: 
-Personal histories of the researchers may influence findings
-Researchers&apos; academic training may influence coding practices
-Time consuming</Notes>

        <Description>QFD stands for Quality Function Deploymentrn. It is a market-driven methodology for products and services to meet or exceed customers needs and expectations. 

QFD helps classify consumers&apos; needs and wants into the appropriate design and delivery functions of one&apos;s organization. Using QFD with value engineering gives the customers what they value as important for themselves; it also helps your organization prioritize what characteristics to build into the product. 

The major goal for performing market research, analyzing the data with QFD, synthesizing results with value engineering and plotting them using value graphs are to incorporate customer voice during early design stages, improve quality, functionality, innovations, responsiveness and upgrade enterprise infrastructure. The goal for a company is to develop a product that consumers like-- and companies do this by figuring out what customers likes and desires are.

QFD-based Value Engineering should be used in the beginning of the design process. The method can be applied to develop a product that consumers like and will purchase.

1. Development of the distribution axis (e.g., strongly agree to strongly disagree)
2. Rather than asking the respondent to group them simply, ask them to distribute them along the axis in a normal distribution (few at each end of the scale, and more in the middle).
3. This method assumes you will use statistical analysis to find higher-order clusterings using results from multiple respondents or multiple sessions with the same respondent.</process>

There are new processes in the analytics of focus groups that involve not just qualitative analysis of the data, but also quantitative analysis.

It is doubtful that quantitative techniques will replace established qualitative approaches, but can supplement and improve insight gained from qualitative analysis.

It is appropriate to use this quantitative analytic method after one has the data from focus groups. It represents a different way to analyze the findings from focus groups, which are normally qualitative.</Description>

        <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&DesignExchange_Methods;Interview_Techniques"/>
        <references>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repertory_grid</references>
        <process>The repertory grid is a technique for identifying the ways that a person construes (interprets/ gives meaning to) his or her experience. It provides information from which inferences about personality can be made, but it is not a personality test in the conventional sense. It is underpinned by the Personal Construct Theory developed by George Kelly first published in 1955.

A grid consists of four parts:

A Topic: it is about some part of the person&apos;s experience
A set of Elements, which are examples or instances of the Topic. Working as a clinical psychologist, Kelly was interested in how his clients construed people in the roles they adopted towards the client, and so, originally, such terms as &apos;my father&apos;, &apos;my mother&apos;, &apos;an admired friend&apos; and so forth were used. Since then, the Grid has been used in much wider settings (educational, occupational, organisational) and so any well-defined set of words, phrases, or even brief behavioral vignettes can be used as elements. For example, to see how I construe the purchase of a car, a list of vehicles within my price range could make an excellent set of elements
A set of Constructs. These are the basic terms that the client uses to make sense of the elements, and are always expressed as a contrast. Thus the meaning of &apos;Good&apos; depends on whether you intend to say &apos;Good versus Poor&apos;, as if you were construing a theatrical performance, or &apos;Good versus Evil&apos;, as if you were construing the moral or ontological status of some more fundamental experience.
A set of ratings of Elements on Constructs. Each element is positioned between the two extremes of the construct using a 5- or 7-point rating scale system; this is done repeatedly for all the constructs that apply; and thus its meaning to the client is captured, and statistical analysis varying from simple counting, to more complex multivariate analysis of meaning, is made possible.
Constructs are regarded as personal to the client, who is psychologically similar to other people depending on the extent to which s/he would tend to use similar constructs, and similar ratings, in relating to a particular set of elements. And it is the way that the constructs are identified that makes a Repertory Grid unique.</process>

3. Start with Know/Know category. Elicit from the group all information about the topic that they kno they know. This category should go quickly and generate a lot of cntent. Have players write one bit of knowldge on each sticky  note and place them a cluster in this category. 
4. Then, tackle Know&apos;Don&apos;t Know category. Have players write what they know and place in cluster near this arrow. 
5. Move to Don&apos;t Know/Know. This information could be skills people have that are currently not used to solve problems or untapped resources that have been forgotten. 
6. Last, move to Don&apos;t Know/Don&apos;t Know. The group will be stopped here, possibly indefinitely. This category is where discovery and shared exploration take place. Ask players provocative questions: What does this know that your team doesn&apos;t know it doesn&apos;t know? How can you find ut what you don&apos;t know you don&apos;t know?
7. Ask the group what they can do to proactively address the distinct challenges of each categor. Discuss the insights and &quot;ahas.&quot; Even if the players only revelation is that thy have blind spots, this in itself can be a fruitful discovery. </process>
        <Description>The premise of this game is to disclose and discover unknown information that can impact organizational and group success in any area of the company-management, planning, team performance, and so forth. </Description>

        <Description>User Panels are regular meetings of service users about the quality of a service or other related topics. They help to identify the concerns and priorities of service users and can lead to the early identification of problems or ideas for improvements.

User Panels usually take the form of a workshop and it is important to outline a clear purpose and the time required for participants&apos; involvement right from the beginning. 

Context: 
You should use User Panels when:
 
• You are working with people who are not usually heard, for example those with learning disabilities, children, and the elderly
• You want to establish a two-way dialogue between service providers and users,
•  You want to set up a sounding board for new approaches or proposals relating to services
• As a way of identifying emerging problems</Description>

In addition, the designer may find general insights from reading existing and archived posts. This method provides a relatively quick way of talking to a wide number of people and can be very useful in gaining a contextual view of a particular topic. Web forums can also be used to post information regarding more detailed surveys and questionnaires. Permission should always be sought from the forum administrator when joining a web forum for professional purposes.

        <Description>&quot;A website wireframe, also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint, is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website. Wireframes are created for the purpose of arranging elements to best accomplish a particular purpose. The purpose is usually being informed by a business objective and a creative idea. The wireframe depicts the page layout or arrangement of the website’s content, including interface elements and navigational systems, and how they work together. The wireframe usually lacks typographic style, color, or graphics, since the main focus lies in functionality, behavior, and priority of content.[3] In other words, it focuses on what a screen does, not what it looks like. Wireframes can be pencil drawings or sketches on a whiteboard, or they can be produced by means of a broad array of free or commercial software applications.&quot;</Description>

2. The cafe ambiance allows for a more relaxed and open conversation to take place. Often participants are provided with pens and are encouraged to draw and record their conversations on the paper tablecloths to capture free flowing ideas as they emerge.
 
3. Participants discuss the issue at hand around their table and at regular intervals they move to a new table. One participant (the table host) remains and summarises the previous conversation to the newly arrived participants. By moving participants around the room the conversations at each table are cross-fertilised with ideas from other tables. At the end of the process the main ideas are summarised in a plenary session and follow-up possibilities are discussed.
 
 
4. The choice of question(s) for the cafe conversation is crucial for the success of your event. In general it is useful to phrase the questions in a positive format and in an open ended format to allow a constructive discussion. If participants do not find the questions for discussion inspiring the event is unlikely to be successful, it can therefore be good to develop the question together with some of the intended participants.

Learn that you know more things about a certain topic than you think.

        <Description>&quot;This method requires writing down all that you know about the subject in question. You must force it out of yourself, though, because you are naturally reluctant to write down the &apos;obvious.&apos; In short, most of what you know is locked inside as potential awaiting your authority for release. Moreover, you&apos;d be surprised at the knowledge two people can recall about a subject by merely &apos;talking it over.&apos; Writing the information down or putting it on tape and then writing it down is all-important. Find a pad and pencil and, either alone or with a friend, outline all you already know about your problem situation. Begin with the &apos;obvious.&apos; It&apos;s probably essential.&quot; - from The Universal Traveler</Description>

        <process>Participants consist of small groups representative of a given society with various skills and areas of expertise.

Participants meet for sets of 1-2 hour or more.

1. Clarify the objective of the Action Learning groups
2. Convene a cross-section of people with complementary skills and expertise to participate
3. Hold initial meetings to analyze the issues and identify actions for resolving them
4. Take action in the work place
5. Use subgroups to work on the specific aspects of the problem if necessary

-Collaborative
-Engages with participants instead of keeping them passive
-Can help change old, inflexible teaching methods

Deficits of Method:
-Organizing meetings can be difficult
-Meetings may be dominated by individuals
